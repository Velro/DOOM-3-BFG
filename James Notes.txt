- Joystick thread runs at 250 fps!

- checkout how idDict is used. "map entity spawning, GUI state management, and other things"
	- where is boundary between c-strings and idStr's? When is each used?
- Do they implement a SIMD memcpy somewhere? Its a function in idSIMDPrcoess
- pick apart their scoped profiler!
- its doing some FPU stuff somewhere, also referred to as x87 online. lets find it!
- Extent of exceptions use?

-CVAR - console variable

- tagged memory - "memory tag names are used to sort allocations for sys_dumpMemory and other reporting functions"
	- yooo they replaced 'new'

- Hierarchy class, may be helpful idea for yamgine

- idStr's have 20 char base, reallocates if a larger string is requested, (32, 64, etc...)
